# Stack0

Unfortunately traditional stack smashing does not work on modern applications since many mitigations have been.
This section will discuss some of the mitigation techniques implemented on modern OSs. This page will be updated as I learn more about how to bypass them.

## Stack Canary

Stack Canaries are usually a section of data after a buffer that store randomly generated numbers. These randomly generated numbers are checked during run time in order to detect overwrites into the stack.
To bypass this you will need access to another vulnerability like information leak to somehow obtain the values at run time.


## ASLR 

ASLR, as the name suggests is a method to randomize the offsets. Bruteforce on 64-bit systems is incredible expensive and is not feasible, so you will need some kind of informaiton leak to access a static offset to calculate all other stack stored values.
Not detrimental, but we need a new vulnerability to get over this so there is an additional cost from the perspective of the attacker.
