# Stack0

Simple bufferoverflow with no protection. Puts writes into a buffer with no checks, and the variable we want to change is conveniently located next to the buffer.
You can overwrite a maximum of 4 bytes without causing issues with the stack. 
The solution input is:

```python
python -c 'print("A"*65)'
```
