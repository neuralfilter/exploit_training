# NOP Sled

Suppose that we have gained control over a function's return address using bufferoverflow. Unfortunately, the application has ASLR enabled and we do not know the actual positions of our shell code we stored somewhere.
We try to guess the relative position of the shell code by inserting a bunch of NOP instructions in the suspected region so that we will, by chance, land on the shell code instruction. NOPs are used since they move to the next instruction without doing anything, however it can really be anything as long as it doesn't change registers significantly.
This is a risky attack since it is easy to detect and will most likely result in a segfault.
