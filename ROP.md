# Exploitation Technique: ROP (Return Oriented Programming)

Modern OSs have built in mitigations against vanilla bufferoverflow by detecting overwrites by the application.
This means we require an exploitation method that keeps the integrity of the code while giving us the ability to freely move through the asm instructions.
To achieve this, people have abstracted sequences of instructions as "gadgets" which would help us execute shellcode.
Some crazy people have proven that this is a turing complete "language", in other words we can make any expression we can think of happen with ROP.

## Weird Machines
> Successful exploitation is always evidence of someone’s incorrect assumptions about the computational nature of the system—in hindsight, which is 20-20. 

In literature you will sometimes come across the term "weird machine" when referring to ROP. From my understanding this is a term coined by Meredith L. Patterson, in her co-author piece "From Buffer Overflows to 'Weird Machines' and Theory of Computation" (http://langsec.org/papers/Bratus.pdf). Although published almost 10 years ago, the paper explores directions of formalizing exploitation methods through language and computability theory. Considering major papers from the offensive perspective have focused on more informal venues like Phrack that focus on methodology, it was refreshing to learn that there are theoretical foundations to this exploitation method.
