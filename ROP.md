# Exploitation Technique: ROP (Return Oriented Programming)

Modern OSs have built in mitigations against vanilla bufferoverflow by detecting overwrites by the application.
This means we require an exploitation method that keeps the integrity of the code while giving us the ability to freely move through the asm instructions.
To achieve this, people have abstracted sequences of instructions as "gadgets" which would help us execute shellcode.
Some crazy people have proven that this is a turing complete "language", in other words we can make any expression we can think of happen with ROP.
